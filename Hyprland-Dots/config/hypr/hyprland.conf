# Hyprland Main Configuration File
#  This is the main configuration file for Hyprland.
#  You can customize various settings here to tailor the window manager to your preferences.
#  However, it is recommended to use external configuration files for better organization and easier management.
#  You can find these external configuration files in the ~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ directory.
#  always refer to Hyprland wiki
